# Agent Activities

## Purpose

Activities are a persistent notification/logging system that tracks important system events and agent actions. They keep users informed about what happened in their agent ecosystem, especially during background or unattended sessions.

## Core Concepts

- **Activity**: A single logged event with type, text, read status, and optional action-required indicator
- **Activity Type**: Category of event (e.g., `session_completed`, `questions_asked`, `error_occurred`, `email_task_incoming`)
- **Action Required**: Flag indicating the activity needs user intervention (e.g., answering agent questions, reviewing an email task)
- **Read/Unread**: Tracking whether the user has seen the activity, with automatic marking after 2 seconds of visibility
- **Activity Stats**: Aggregated counts (unread, action-required) used by the sidebar bell indicator

## User Stories / Flows

**1. Background Session Notification**
1. User starts an agent session and closes the browser
2. Agent completes work (or encounters error, or asks questions)
3. System creates appropriate activity with `is_read=false`
4. User returns, sees unread indicator on sidebar bell icon
5. User opens Activities page, sees new activity cards
6. After 2 seconds of visibility, activities auto-mark as read

**2. Action-Required Workflow**
1. Agent asks questions while user is disconnected
2. System creates `questions_asked` activity with `action_required="answers_required"`
3. Sidebar bell turns red (destructive color)
4. User clicks activity card, navigates to the session to answer questions

**3. Email Task Activity Lifecycle**
1. Email arrives, system creates input task and `email_task_incoming` activity
2. User reviews and executes the task, `email_task_incoming` is dismissed
3. Task completes, `email_task_reply_pending` activity created
4. User sends email reply, `email_task_reply_pending` dismissed

**4. Session State Declaration**
1. Agent uses `update_session_state` tool to declare outcome (completed/needs_input/error) with a summary
2. System creates activity with the agent's summary text
3. If `needs_input`, activity has `action_required="answers_required"`
4. Generic `session_completed` activity is skipped when agent already declared a result state

## Business Rules

- **One activity per event**: No duplicate activities for the same event (exception: `session_running` is temporary and replaced with final state)
- **User ownership**: Activities are private, only visible to the owning user
- **Cascade deletion**: Activities deleted when related session/agent is deleted (database foreign keys)
- **Read state is one-way**: Once marked read, stays read (no "mark as unread")
- **Action required is immutable**: Set at creation, never changes
- **Session running lifecycle**: `session_running` is temporary - deleted if frontend is watching, replaced with final state if not
- **Error tracking**: Error activities always created, even if frontend was watching (important for audit trail)
- **Workspace inheritance**: Activity inherits `user_workspace_id` from its linked session, task, or agent
- **Result state priority**: When agent declares `result_state` via session state tool, the generic `session_completed` activity is skipped in favor of the more meaningful state-specific activity

### Activity Types

| Type | Text | Action Required | Trigger |
|------|------|-----------------|---------|
| `session_running` | "Session is running" | (none) | Stream starts |
| `session_completed` | "Session completed" | (none) | Stream completes, user disconnected, no result_state |
| `session_feedback_required` | Agent summary | `answers_required` | Agent declares `needs_input` state |
| `questions_asked` | "Agent asked questions that need answers" | `answers_required` | Stream completes with unanswered questions |
| `error_occurred` | "Error: {message}" (truncated 100 chars) | (none) | Stream error |
| `email_task_incoming` | "New email task received" | `task_review_required` | Email-originated task created |
| `email_task_reply_pending` | "Task completed. Email reply pending." | `reply_pending` | Email task status changes to completed |

### Sidebar Bell Indicator

Located in the sidebar footer. The bell icon has two visual indicators:

**Icon color** (notification state):
- Default: No unread activities
- Primary (blue): Unread informational activities
- Destructive (red): Unread activities requiring action

**Status dot** (connection state — small colored circle on the bell icon):
- Green: Connected (online)
- Yellow: Connecting
- Red: Disconnected (offline)

The tooltip shows both the label "Activities" and the current connection status (e.g., "Activities (Online)").

## Event-Driven Architecture

Activities are created/managed by event handlers registered at app startup:

| Event | Handler | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `STREAM_STARTED` | `handle_stream_started` | Creates `session_running` activity |
| `STREAM_COMPLETED` | `handle_stream_completed` | If user connected: deletes running. If disconnected: creates completion + questions activities |
| `STREAM_ERROR` | `handle_stream_error` | Deletes running, always creates `error_occurred` |
| `STREAM_INTERRUPTED` | `handle_stream_interrupted` | Deletes running, no completion (session resumable) |
| `SESSION_STATE_UPDATED` | `handle_session_state_updated` | Deletes running, creates state-specific activity with agent summary |
| `TASK_CREATED` | `handle_task_created` | Creates `email_task_incoming` (only for email-sourced tasks) |
| `TASK_STATUS_UPDATED` | `handle_task_status_changed` | Manages email task activity lifecycle (dismiss incoming, create/dismiss reply_pending) |

**Connected vs Disconnected Detection**: Uses `event_service.is_user_connected(user_id)` to determine whether to create notification activities or just clean up the running indicator.

## Integration Points

- [Event Bus](../realtime_events/event_bus_system.md) - All activity creation is event-driven via `EventService.register_handler()`
- [Agent Sessions](../agent_sessions/agent_sessions.md) - Activities track session lifecycle (running, completed, error, interrupted)
- [Input Tasks](../input_tasks/input_tasks.md) - Email task activities link to tasks via `input_task_id`
- [Email Sessions](../email_integration/email_sessions.md) - Email task incoming/reply pending activities
- [Streaming](../realtime_events/frontend_backend_agentenv_streaming.md) - `MessageService` emits streaming events that trigger activity creation
- [Agent Environments](../../agents/agent_environments/agent_environments.md) - Activities resolve agent_id through environment lookup
- [Agent Handover](../../agents/agent_handover/agent_handover.md) - Direct handovers create target-agent sessions that generate the full session activity lifecycle (running → completed/error), notifying target agent owners of delegated work

## Sidebar Layout

The Activities bell is in the sidebar footer (below the main navigation), alongside dashboard switcher, agentic teams, appearance, and user menu. The main navigation menu (Dashboard, Tasks, Agents, Sessions, Credentials) is in the content area above.

## Statistics & Polling

- Stats endpoint returns `unread_count` and `action_required_count`
- Sidebar polls stats every 10 seconds, plus real-time WebSocket event invalidation
- Activities list page subscribes to WebSocket events for real-time updates
- Pagination: default limit 100, loaded at once

## Future Enhancements

- Activity grouping (e.g., "Agent created 5 files")
- User preferences for activity types
- Browser push notifications for action-required activities
- Activity search and filtering by date/type/read status
- Mark all as read bulk action
- Auto-delete old activities after retention period
